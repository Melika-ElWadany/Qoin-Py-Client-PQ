Blockchain Project

Overview:

This project implements a simple blockchain using Python. It allows users to create wallets, make transactions, and mine blocks. The blockchain is stored in a SQLite database, and transactions are verified using cryptographic signatures.

Features:

Wallet Creation: Users can create wallets with unique public and private keys.
Transaction Handling: Users can initiate transactions between wallets.
Block Mining: Miners can verify transactions and create new blocks.
Blockchain Verification: The integrity of the blockchain is maintained by verifying each transaction and block.
Technologies Used:

Python
SQLite
SQLAlchemy
Requests
Cryptography
